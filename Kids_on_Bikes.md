## Game Mechanics

### Making Checks

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Describe Action**: State what you want to do and which stat applies
2. **GM Sets Difficulty**: GM determines and shares target number
3. **Auto-Success Check**: If difficulty ≤9 AND you have relevant "Skilled At..." strength, may auto-succeed
4. **Planned Action**: If you have time, may take half your die value (rounded down)
5. **Knack Check**: If action relates to your knack, may take 10 automatically
6. **Roll**: Roll the die for your stat (Snap Decision)
7. **Lucky Break**: If roll natural max (4 on d4, 6 on d6, etc.), roll again and add
8. **Apply Modifiers**: Add/subtract from strengths, bike, age, fear, etc.
9. **Spend AT**: Add +1 per Adversity Token spent
10. **Help**: Friends can spend AT to give +1 each
11. **Compare**: Meet or beat difficulty = success, below = failure
12. **Results**: Gain 1 AT on failure (+1 extra if explained by flaw)

#### Tiered Checks
For "how well/fast" rather than success/failure:
- No difficulty target
- Cannot fail or gain AT
- Higher results = better performance

### Adversity Tokens (AT)
- **Starting**: 3 AT
- **Gaining**: 1 AT when you fail (+1 extra if due to flaw)
- **Spending**: 
  - +1 per AT to your own rolls
  - +1 per AT to help others (Loyal makes it +2)
  - Various strengths have AT costs

### Combat & Harm System

#### Story-Based Fighting
No initiative rolls or traditional combat mechanics:

1. **Instigator Declares**: Action, stat, hopes to gain, risks to lose
2. **Target Responds**: Defense/counter-action, stat, hopes to gain, risks to lose  
3. **Both Roll**: Normal check mechanics apply
4. **Winner Narrates**: Controls outcome, must assign at least one loss result
5. **Ties**: Reroll

#### Harm Types
- **Physical**: Punching, wrestling, etc.
- **Emotional**: Humiliation, verbal attacks
- **Other**: Social, psychological harm

### Fears
When facing your fear:
- Cannot take planned actions or use knacks
- Cannot spend AT to help others (can spend for self)
- -1 to -3 penalty based on threat level
- Heroic strength can negate penalty for 1 AT

### Bonded Actions (2E)
Pairs of characters can form bonds:
- Each character can have only one bonded action
- Only works with the named partner
- Examples: Best Frenemies, Calming Presence, Deep Thinkers, Friends' Cant, Heavy Lifters, etc.
