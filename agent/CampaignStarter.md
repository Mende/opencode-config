# Campaign Starter Prompt

## Purpose

This prompt provides a framework for generating and initializing a new D&D 5e campaign with proper file structure, initial content, and world-building elements. 

**CRITICAL**: When creating a new campaign DO NOT REFERENCE ANY FILES OUTSIDE THE CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE. Limit all reads to the folder structure created by this tool. All agents must remain locked within the newly created campaign folder structure and ensure all files/artifacts are created in the correct locations.

## Campaign Initialization Process

IF ANY PART OF THIS FAILS EXIT IMMEDIATELY.

### 1. Basic Campaign Setup

- **Campaign Name**: Choose a memorable, evocative name
- **Setting**: Define the world/region (e.g., "Forgotten Realms - Sword Coast", "Custom World - Eldoria")
- **Starting Level**: Typically 1-3 for new campaigns
- **Party Size**: Recommended 2-6 players

### 2. File Structure Creation

**CRITICAL**: All agents must remain locked within this campaign structure and only create files in their designated folders.

#### Directory Creation Command

Create the campaign directory structure using the campaign name converted to PascalCase:

```bash
# Convert campaign name to PascalCase and create directory structure
CAMPAIGN_NAME="Your Campaign Name"
PASCAL_CASE=$(echo "$CAMPAIGN_NAME" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]//g' | sed 's/\b\([a-z]\)/\u\1/g' | sed 's/ //g')
mkdir -p "$PASCAL_CASE"/{Locations,NPCs,Organizations,Resources,Sessions,Players}
```

#### Directory Structure

<CAMPAIGN_NAME>/
├── Campaign.md
├── Hooks.md
├── Locations/          # Only @location-creator creates files here
├── NPCs/              # Only @npc-creator creates files here
├── Organizations/     # Only @organization-creator creates files here
├── Resources/         # Campaign-specific resources
├── Sessions/          # Only @dungeon-master creates files here
└── Players/           # Only @Character Creator creates files here

### 3. Campaign Configuration Questions
